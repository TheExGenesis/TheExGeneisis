Here I'll keep books and pieces I read that have influenced my thinking, and usually contain new concepts that I've integrated into my models of the world.

##### Books:

* [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) (Bostrom)  — On problems we might face when we eventually develop general AI.
* [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) (Harari) — A very famous meme, still a beautiful overview/digest of human history. It helps in building a "frame" to fill with your own independent study of history.
* [The Dictator’s Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Dictators-Handbook-Behavior-Almost-Politics/dp/1610391845) (de Mesquita Bueno) — On dynamics of governance and maintaining power.
* [The Elephant in the Brain ](https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday/dp/0190495995)(Simler, Hanson) — A remarkable book on signalling and unconscious self-interested action.
* [Algorithms to Live by](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) (Christian, Griffiths) — I can stress enough how valuable this book is. As a computer scientist, I was already aware and applying several of the concepts here to my own life, but it was helpful to see it all laid out at once. Will do a post on this eventually.
* [Skin In the Game ](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X)(Taleb) — Skin in the game as an important factor for the good functioning of human (or not) complex systems.
* [Gateless](https://www.amazon.com/Gateless-Sebastian-Marshall-ebook/dp/B00QANG7GM) (Marshall) — A ton of great life-authoring advice that I mostly fail to follow. Will do a piece on this eventually.
* [A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/) (Wolfram) — An interactive tome about a "a new kind of science" done through computational experiments, especially cellular automata. Highlight concepts might be [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) and the principle of computational irreducibility. The book is by no means rigorous or universally well liked.  
  I haven't read all the way through but there's a lot of philosophical value offered by many insights in the book. There's[ a particularly biting review](http://bactra.org/reviews/wolfram/) that is itself a good read.
* [I Am a Strange Loop](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030793) (D. Hoftstadter) — By the author of _Godel, Escher, Bach_, it details what Hofstadter considered the most important (but underappreciated) takeaway from his other book. Deals with the recursive nature of consciousness and other dynamics within the soul and brain.
* [King, Warrior, Magician, Lover](https://www.amazon.com/King-Warrior-Magician-Lover-Rediscovering/dp/0062506064) (R. Moore, D. Gillette) — An exploration of the role of four Jungian archetypes and their immature forms in men (although I think women could read and identify themselves in this just as well). Being aware of these archetypes helps you think about your own internal life more effectively. The authors also "make the argument that mature masculinity is not abusive or domineering, but generative, creative, and empowering of the self and others".
* [The Book of Why](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/0141982411) (J. Pearl) — Pearl's communication of the much needed branch of Causal Inference in Probability to the general reader. Great for any scientist dealing with data and statistics, but also for anyone who would like to boost their thinking toolbox.
* [The Dawn of Eurasia](https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Eurasia-Trail-World-Order/dp/0241309255) (B. Maçães) — A travel book through central Eurasia, a fresh perspective on its geopolitics, and an account and prediction of the rise of a Russia-China partnership, this time with China as the senior partner. Not a perfect book, but still illuminates what I believe is a deeply under-documented part of the world.
* [Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self](https://www.amazon.com/Aion-Researches-Phenomenology-Collected-Works/dp/069101826X) (C. G. Jung) — One of Jung's most important works, according to some. He explains the ego, the shadow, the anima and animus before delving into the exploration of the symbol of the Self, through analysis of Christian, gnostic, and alchemical symbolism.

##### Written Pieces:

* [The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html) — Short fiction on death reflecting on the (not really) inevitablity of death, and how we might overcome it.
* [Logic, Explainability and the Future of Understanding](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/) — Introduces experimental mathematics and the impossibility to understand some proofs and systems because they will be computationally equivalent to our brains. Introduces an idea of information systems we don't understand as becoming part of our environment like nature, the alternative being choosing only to interact with systems much simpler than our own.
* [The Gig Economy](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/) — Lovecraft flavoured short-story riffing on the gig economy, autonomous AI empowered by crypto, and trans-humanism.
* [Hell-baked](http://www.xenosystems.net/hell-baked/) — Poignantly illustrates the ruthless horror of evolution.
* [Memetic Tribes and Culture War 2.0](https://medium.com/intellectual-explorers-club/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb) — A bit of memetics, a bit of tribalism.
* [Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/) — Fabulous piece on leverage points in complex systems that I try to reread as often as I can.
* [Prickles and Goo](https://meltingasphalt.com/prickles-and-goo/) — Explains the concept of _Prickly_ and _Gooey_ personality as the _hard_ and _soft_ parts of our identities. He goes into what this means for the Self, seeing _prickles_ as conditions for the identity, and _goo_ as possible states, meaning that a Zen identity would be achieved when _prickliness_ is minimal, thus _goo_ all-encompassing. He also considers how different "games" might require different configurations of _prickles_ and _goo_.
* [Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) — "_They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven!"_ Speaking of the self-sabotaging behavior that emerges from collective human action as _Moloch's will_ is one of the most valuable vocabulary acquisitions I've made lately. An instructive, clairvoyant write-up, introduced beautifully by Allen Ginsberg's poem. (fun fact, Swain used this paragraph's first phrase as a lyric in their song _Howl)_
* [Mental Models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) — Mental models have become kind of a meme in some circles, but I do think that having a list of concepts and framings for problems is super useful, so here you go.
* [Places where reality is a bit altered](https://silent-wordsmith.tumblr.com/post/147470432974/places-where-reality-is-a-bit-altered) — Just a list with a short explanation. Most of them are liminal spaces between two others.
* [Progressive Summarization](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes-3459b257d3eb/) — A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes. 
* [What Should You Do with Your Life? Directions and Advice](https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/) — Collection of links with advice for decision-making in life.

##### Interactive Pieces

* [The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) — An interactive introduction to Game Theory
* [To Build a Better Ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/) — Interactive exploration of voting systems.
* [Going Critical](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/) — Intuition on criticality in networks. Huge concepts in memetics.

##### Blogs

* [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) — The classic blog on rationality and decision-making
* [Slate Star Codex ](https://slatestarcodex.com)— a (delightful) "blog about science, medicine, philosophy, politics, and futurism"
* [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net) — Legend of the internet, crypto, and other odd topics.
* [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com) — Refactored perception, magical thinking, and other goodies. Some people like their older stuff better.
* [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/) — David Chapman's colossal hypertext book on philosophy and most things in life. I haven't read enough of it to give a fair impression, but I was pleased with what I've read so far and continue curious about it.
* [Melting Asphalt](https://meltingasphalt.com/) — A blog with great, accessible articles on complex topics
* [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/blog/) — For those struggling with what to do in life, a career guide based on Effective Altruism.
* [Epsilon Theory](https://www.epsilontheory.com) — A blog about investing and politics, although I see much more in it. I read it because it ends up being about society, about drawing new insights from complex and confusing data. They were the first people I knew of to make a "blog graph" like I've wanted to for so long, and they innovatively started using NLP to analyze the US presidential election.
* [Farnham Street](https://fs.blog) — A blog about learning and decision-making.
* [Patrick Collision](https://patrickcollison.com/advice) — He's got a pretty cool website with good advice and interesting lists of several kinds.
* [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/) — This guy is about my age and I can see he thinks similarly to me and has struggled with the same topics of friendship, purpose, and blogging. I'll keep this link here for a bit, see how I feel.
