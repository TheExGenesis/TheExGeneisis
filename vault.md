This is basically supposed to be a living CV.

Pages for things I've done, projects I am undertaking now, ones I've finished, or just chapters of my life that are over and can be delimited.

For example, I'm almost done with a [CS degree](_projects/uni.md). I'm working on a thesis in AI Alignment. (hopefully) And I also have [a band](_projects/gnu.md) going on.
