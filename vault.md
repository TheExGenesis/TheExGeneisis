# **The Vault**

Here I'll keep books and pieces I read that have influenced my thinking, and usually contain new concepts that I've integrated into my models of the world.

##### Books:

Superintelligence – Bostrom  
\- On problems we might face when we eventually develop general AI.

The Dictator’s Handbook – de Mesquita Bueno  
\- On dynamics of governance and maintaining power.

The Elephant in the Brain - Simler, Hanson  
\- A remarkable book on signalling and unconscious self-interested action.

Algorithms to Live - Christian, Griffiths  
\- I can stress enough how valuable this book is. As a computer scientist, I was already aware and applying several of the concepts here to my own life, but it was helpful to see it all layed out at once. Will do a post on this eventually.

Skin In the Game – Taleb  
\- Skin in the game as an important factor for the good functioning of human (or not) complex systems.

Gateless – Marshall  
 - A ton of great life-authoring advice that I mostly fail to follow. Will do a piece on this eventually.

[A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/) - Wolfram  
\- This is an interactive tome about a "a new kind of science" done through computational experiments, especially cellular automata. Highlight concepts might be [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) and the principle of computational irreducibility.   
The book is by no means rigorous or universally well liked.   
I haven't read all the way through but there's a lot of philosophical value offered by many insights in the book. There's[ a particularly biting review](http://bactra.org/reviews/wolfram/) that is itself a good read.

##### Written Pieces:

[The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html)   
Short fiction on death reflecting on the (not really) inevitablity of death, and how we might overcome it.

[Logic, Explainability and the Future of Understanding](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/)  
\- Introduces experimental mathematics and the impossibility to understand some proofs and systems because they will be computationally equivalent to our brains. Introduces an idea of information systems we don't understand as becoming part of our environment like nature, the alternative being choosing only to interact with systems much simpler than our own.

[The Gig Economy](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/)  
\- Lovecraft flavoured short-story riffing on the gig economy, autonomous AI empowered by crypto, and trans-humanism.  
[Hell-baked](http://www.xenosystems.net/hell-baked/)  
\- Poignantly illustrates the ruthless horror of evolution.  
[Memetic Tribes and Culture War 2.0](https://medium.com/intellectual-explorers-club/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb)   
\- A bit of memetics, a bit of tribalism.  
[Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)  
\- Fabulous piece on leverage points in complex systems that I try to reread as often as I can.

[Prickles and Goo](https://meltingasphalt.com/prickles-and-goo/)  
\- Explains the concept of _Prickly_ and _Gooey_ personality as the _hard_ and _soft_ parts of our identities. He goes into what this means for the Self, seeing _prickles_ as conditions for the identity, and _goo_ as possible states, meaning that a Zen identity would be achieved when _prickliness_ is minimal, thus _goo_ all-encompassing. He also considers how different "games" might require different configurations of _prickles_ and _goo_.

##### Interactive Pieces

[The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) - Case  
An interactive introduction to Game Theory

[To Build a Better Ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/) - Case  
Interactive exploration of voting systems.

[Going Critical](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/), Simler in Melting Asphalt  
Intuition on criticality in networks. Huge concepts in memetics.
