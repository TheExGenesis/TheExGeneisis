<p>I have big plans for this. Supposed to be a chronological mess of writings, the quality of which might vary drastically. I'll usually be writing with a hypothetical audience in mind as I don't currently have one. I'll be thinking of my friends and family, just so you know.</p>
</br>

<p>I expect I'll do ~5 different broad types of posts (I might or might not tag them as they come):</p>
</br>
<p>1. Weekly link selection of neat things I find (like a newsletter)</p>
</br>
<p>2. Reports about stuff I've spent some amount of time doing. (Like travels or deep dives into the weeds of the internet)</p>
</br>
<p>3. Essays about anything, usually introespective and poetic in flavor. Or fiction.</p>
</br>
<p>4. Concept explainers and crazy or unpolished ideas.</p>
</br>
<p>5. Creative or scientific articles that adhere to high standards and are significantly polished.</p>
</br>
