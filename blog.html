I have big plans for this. Supposed to be a chronological mess of writings, the quality of which might vary drastically. I'll usually be writing with a hypothetical audience in mind as I don't currently have one. I'll be thinking of my friends and family, just so you know.

I expect I'll do ~5 different broad types of posts (I might or might not tag them as they come):
1. Weekly link selection of neat things I find (like a newsletter)
2. Reports about stuff I've spent some amount of time doing. (Like travels or deep dives into the weeds of the internet)
3. Essays about anything, usually introespective and poetic in flavor. Or fiction.
4. Concept explainers and crazy or unpolished ideas.
5. Creative or scientific articles that adhere to high standards and are significantly polished.
