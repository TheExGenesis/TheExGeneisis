- Offering number 4!, in my humble opinion, is the best one yet. I've completed a full month of offerings, which means I get to start a mailing list and YOU get to sign up!
- [The Handbook for Radical Local Democracy](https://www.radicalxchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The_Handbook_for_Radical_Local_Democracy.pdf) - [[The Handbook for Radical Local Democracy]]
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fxiqo%2FLXLHcINTck?alt=media&token=9ef5e871-16db-437c-a659-fbac98d9eb80)
    - "A handbook of new social technologies for collaborating across difference." condenses 3 ideas that - given our present predicament - might become commonplace sooner rather than later. (embedded in the [RadXChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/resources/) movement, which is based on a book called [Radical Markets](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36515770-radical-markets) ) In ~11 pages for each concept you get clear answers to the questions 'Why?' 'What?', 'How?', examples, and implementation tips.
    - These ideas are 
        - Quadratic voting, which solves the problem that most voting systems used for official decision-making are shit. It lets voters express their wishes with more precision by starting with a pool of "voting credits" and then reallocating them to the issues that matter most to them. The twist is that speaking louder has a cost, so if you want to cast n votes on a topic, it'll cost you n^2 credits.
        - Quadratic finance, is a mechanism for financing public goods by a central matching of funds contributed by individuals. "Namely, the total funding for a proposal is the square roots of each private contribution, summed up, and then squared." The result of this is that proposals with few contributors get little or no matching, while proposals with many contributors would get large matches in funding.
        - and SALSA (Self-Assessed Licenses Sold via Auction) for pricing access to a limited resource like plots of land. You set your own price and pay tax on that, but if someone else comes along and would by your land at that price, you'll either have to sell or pay higher taxes. This solves black markets (if licenses were sold at a fixed rate) and holdout problems (when an auction takes place once but people's values change over time).

- [The Psychonaut Field Manual](https://www.deviantart.com/bluefluke/art/The-Psychonaut-Field-Manual-FOURTH-PDF-EDITION-530005584) - [[The Psychonaut Field Manual]]

    - A beautiful visual guide for the psychonaut. To be taken with A TON OF SALT, but gave me much needed example on how a contemporary's whole framework for the arcane. As you might know by now (if you follow my [weekly offerings](the-altar) ), I reject any models that require a supernatural axis. This field guide is consistent with an agnostic ontology, as it seems heavily influenced by a __chaos magic__ mindset. At the same time, I am reading this through my own personal filter, which means I'm filling in many of the ambiguities with things that are consistent with my models and discarding the few things that don't quite fit.
    - I was surprised by how many of the things featured I've been exposed to over the years:- __Belief as a tool__, meta-systematic thinking: as in adopting whichever system of thinking is appropriate in a situation.
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fxiqo%2FN-YN2jJoNI?alt=media&token=31c24473-0761-48d6-a6a3-65559bab7684)
- Meditation, and the state of __gnosis__, a name for the moment of focus where all thought is stripped away.
- __Lucid dreaming__, with which I experimented as teen.
- This was the first time I've seen anyone else recognize that "third-eye tingling" in my forehead, but apparently it's more common than I thought. 
- Childhood experiences with my parents had me interacting with auras, and astral projection but I never really could integrate them in any epistemological framework.
    - What surprised me the most and expanded my horizons in terms of phenomenology to try is something I'll agnostically call __sub-agent bending__. Basically you commit some intentions (e.g. relaxing, emulating someone, remembering to ) to your subconscious through whatever processes you like and then it those intentions start working autonomously in the back burner. The results will vary depending on the intensity of the rituals you use to commit your intentions to the unconscious mind. The handbook implies you can actually eventually chat and visualize these autonomous sub-agents. Personally I'm skeptical, but I've never ventured deep enough into these experiments. These dynamics would shed some light on stories about visions and interactions with gods, as those would be cases of archetypal structures in the unconscious mind creatively communicating with their conscious component.
"An __egregore__ is a distributed [sub-agent], which uses a network of individuals as processing power" sound familiar? Egregores and memetic possession fit into this model of the arcane, because of course they do.

    - Born in Morocco, travelled North Africa, the Middle East, the Steppes of Crimea, India, Indonesia, China, the empire of Mali in an era where the fastest overland transport was a horse in a caravan. Also, kind of an asshole.
    - While I do own [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/517598.The_Travels_of_Ibn_Battutah), I haven't read it yet. I have, however, been exposed to many internet retellings and youtube videos about segments of his story. Extra Credits is a gem of yt and they recently made a series about him:
[Ibn Battuta - The Great Traveler - Extra History](https://youtu.be/TEI0sVYKtg8)
We also follow him in of the Mali Empire episodes (Mali is a great story too):
[https://youtu.be/YPytwp5ll9g](The Empire of Mali - An Empire of Trade and Faith - Extra History)
    - I think it's worthwhile to mention it here as his life is one of the most unbelievable adventures on record and the parts of the world he visited have long captured a meaningful portion of my aesthetics.

    - Graph-tool is an efficient [Python](http://www.python.org/) module for manipulation and statistical analysis of [graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29) (a.k.a. [networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory)) with great visualization 
    - Last semester I analyzed a sample of twitter in to write a [course paper](https://github.com/TheExGenesis/memetic_tribes/blob/master/Memetic%20Tribes%20in%20Twitter%20Mutual%20Networks.pdf) about my search for __memetic tribes__ on twitter. I used a mix of networkX, Gephi, and matplotlib that made me want to kill myself. 
    - Wish I'd known about this beforehand. Now I'm using graph-tool for an expanded, web version of the paper that is taking its sweet time to get done, but it's getting done right. Also I became acquainted with a much cleaner way to lay out large community graphs (the kind in the picture) instead of taking screenshots of [Gephi monstruosities](https://twitter.com/ExGenesis/status/1226213714371715074).

I hope everyone's settled into their new lives as apartment dwellers. Personally, my lifestyle hasn't suffered great changes. I'm enjoying getting flashbacks from highschool times of frolicking aimlessly in the tide pools of the early 2010's web. Now I'm back to present you with the finest pearls I found. (also check out [last week's](offering-2-quarantine-edition) offering)

## [Chaos Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_magic)
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fxiqo%2FiY9YAEl2_c?alt=media&token=ba30aa2a-6361-4f77-98f3-a11e93dd7203)
- I haven't delved very deep into the topic, but I've seen some good indicators that I'll want to. It just seems connected to so many things I've been interested in: information systems, complex networks, psychonauts like Terrence McKenna and Alan Moore, works like _The Sandman_ and _The Invisibles_, lovecraftian egregores, Jung and the collective unconscious, comparative religion, memetics, etc. Two more reasons why I'm drawn to this:
- First, the word _chaos_ points to the intractable and the yet-unmapped, which coincide with where I think the usually referred as "supernatural" lies. 
- Second, its meta-belief that "belief is a tool for achieving effects". It seems like symbols and practices from many mystical traditions are seen as manifestations of the same archetypes and used interchangeably. However, it feels quite postmodern (in the _hurr nothing means anything_ sense) and I question from the outside how benign that bit is.
- This focus on instrumental beliefs brings to mind something I read in _The Elephant in the brain_ on how having disparate conscious and unconscious beliefs can be adaptive because your body language will convey a set of beliefs, while your underlying evolutionary aims (held unconsciously) are something else. 

- I like how it's agnostic towards supernatural models of the world, which I reject outright. Practitioners explain the mechanics of chaos magic with different models. A rough way in which I see it (again, as an outsider) is something like: You use your energy or attention and symbols to condition your unconscious - which can be thought of as a mass of autonomous spirit helpers (in shamanic language) - to work towards your conscious goals.

- Recently, (according to almighty wikipedia) it seems practitioners have found that it is not strictly indifferent which symbols and traditions one uses and have started delving into old lineage traditions, which pushes back some of the postmodern notions initially associated with the discipline and makes sense because the oldest traditions are _lindy_ and their symbolism has been honed by time.

- Finally, I want to bookmark some potential connections with metarationality and Kegan level 5 in the sense of holding different models of the world at different times.

## [Ithalqua, the wind walker](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/ithaqua-the-wind-walker/), 
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fxiqo%2FngJHB954nw?alt=media&token=48c69236-7d3c-4d8d-b456-1f09909bf8d2)
- Last week I shared this blog _Exploring Egregores_ that wrote about ideas as eldritch lovecraftian gods - which I hadn't fully read - but now that I have, this is the one that stuck with me the most.

- Ithalqua is visually associated with the _Wendigo_, it is also called the kidnapper, and wanders the icy polar wastes. Like Elsa in Frozen, it is self-reliant, and stands for one's turning away from society to delve into one's projects or self. 

- The faustian bargain here is that you become incomprehensible to others and detached from human ties. To me, the icy wastes it dwells in are the effort others must go through to reach you in your castle of jargon and introspection after doing your own thing for a while.

- I feel I've been somewhat frost-bound, headed to this state of mind and it's one of the reasons I'm trying so hard to work with my garage door open. That way I'm leaving a trail of breadcrumbs as I leave civilization for concept space and introspection.

## [Information Geometry](http://bactra.org/notebooks/info-geo.html) - thinking spatially about the fuzzy
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fxiqo%2F9bTtGWj8ql?alt=media&token=ef4940dc-201a-400d-aaba-93319f8aba73)
- A friend brought this field of math to my attention while co-introspecting a bit. I consider this as much part of my AI research as of my arcane studies - I haven't seriously studied it though, so it's just a bookmark.

- The link shared is from Cosma Shalizi's blog _Bactra_ (ancient hellenic Tajikistan/Uzbekistan) and he describes the field as the application of differential geometry to probability distributions, and so to statistical models.

- From what I gather, Information Geometry studies manifolds where points are distributions. Put in a very libertine way: It's differential geometry where KL-divergence (or relative entropy) works as a metric (but not really because it's asymmetric) and Fisher information (2nd derivative of the likelihood function, and the inverse of the covariance matrix) works as curvature. (If I'm not egregiously mistaken) This allows people to prove theorems about statistical models by conceptualizing them as well-behaved geometrical objects and then using geometrical tools on them. John Baez has a [nice series of posts](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/) for anyone seeking more technical insight.

- This is relevant to me because of the way I visualize the information flows of research, discovery, and creativity in my head.

## [Memoirs of Babur by Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur](https://youtu.be/WEDo4WmCwB8)
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fxiqo%2FFQmFzz3bkI?alt=media&token=3d9f824a-9d22-4bfc-aefd-c3c8d8356633)
- SPEAKING OF BACTRIA (best segway I could ask for) This the 500 year-old journal of Babur, the founder of the Mughal empire and descendant of Timmur and Genghis Khan. He was born in the Fergana valley in modern Uzbekistan. A rags-to-riches true story told candidly in the first person. I have a total crush for Silk Road/Central Asian aesthetics because of the eclectic mix of people, cultures, and faiths. Plus this ties in well with chaos magic's arc of different ontologies coexisting.

- Caspian Report is also just an awesome geopolitics channel that I watch all the time.

- WHAT A RIP jagged math rock with a varnish layer of pop production. Anime-opening verses, intricate weavings of rhythms and voice as a first-class citizen. That album intro is particularly delicious.
