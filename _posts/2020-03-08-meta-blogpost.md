I have big plans for this blog. It is supposed to be a chronological mess of writings, the quality of which might vary. I'll usually be writing with a hypothetical audience in mind as I don't currently have one. I'll be thinking of my friends and family, just so you know.
I expect I'll do ~5 different broad types of posts (I might or might not tag them as they come):

 1. [_Weekly offerings_](_projects/the-altar.md) - a curation of links selection to obscure things I find and appreciate.
 2. _Reports_ about stuff I've spent some amount of time doing. (Like travels or deep dives into the weeds of the internet)
 3. _Essays_ about anything, usually introespective and poetic in flavor. Or fiction.
 4. _Concept explainers_ and crazy or unpolished ideas.
 5. Creative or scientific _articles_ that adhere to high standards and are significantly polished.
