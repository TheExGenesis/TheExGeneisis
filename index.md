Oh hey, I've been expecting you. Welcome to my little node of the web. Since you're here, you should probably know a few things.

**BIO**

xiq is short for Francisco, my name

I'm based in Lisbon, Portugal

I'm into mostly everything, including mathematics, philosophy, psychology, geopolitics, economics, language, art, memes, you name it. I know I know, _Jack of all trades, master of none..._ I'm looking for a unique synergy between my interests where I can be particularly useful. Sometimes I think I'm just into the complex systems elements in each subject. 

Currently a master's student in Computer Science, with a focus on AI

Thinking about AI Governance, Safety, and Policy

I also make some [music](/_projects/gnu.md "GNU, the band") and philosophy here

[**SIDEQUESTS**](sidequests.html)

My interests range widely, and I do a lot of seemingly disconnected stuff. I like to call them sidequests, and they take up a bit of a fractal structure, in that they go arbitrarily deep and arbitrarily wide in scope. I'm using the website to make sense of these fractal sidequests. Most of them live in the [sidequests page](sidequests.html "Sidequests page").

[**THE VAULT**](vault.md)

If you're the curious type, you'll want to browse [_The Vault_](vault.md "The Vault"). It's where I keep all my treasures: books, writings, and other links that I find interesting, important, or have otherwise influenced my thinking.

**CONNECT**

I'm seasonally active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home), and I oscillate between insightful discussion and dumb memes. Send me a DM if you'd like to reach me.

You can also reach me at francisco.de.carvalho@tecnico.ulisboa.pt for more formal inquiries.
