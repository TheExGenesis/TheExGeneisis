Hi I'm xiqo, and this is home. 

I _aggressively dig_ the universe, this world, and human experience so I'm spending every moment of my life deliberately building a grand theory of everything.

I run a blog here as well, you can see all my posts [here](blog.html). I recommend taking a look at these, if you're new:
