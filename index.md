Oh hey, I've been expecting you. Welcome to my little node of the web. Since you're here, you should probably know a few things.

**BIO**

xiq is short for Francisco, my name

I'm based in Lisbon, Portugal

currently a master's student in Computer Science, with a focus on AI

thinking about AI Governance, Safety, and Policy

I also make some [music]( "gnu.html") and philosophy here

**SITE**

my interests range wide, and I do a lot of seemingly disconnected stuff. I'm using the website to make sense of the fractal-like side-quests. I document most of them at the [sidequests page](pages/sidequests.html "Sidequests page").
