Hi I'm xiqo, and this is home. 


My life is about pulling multi-armed bandits. I shuffle on the dancefloor until others are ready to join in.

Deliberately building a grand theory of everything. Into memes, art, geopolitics, complex systems, computer science, in that order. It's a striving thing, not a goal. 


There's a blog here as well, you can see all my posts [here](blog.html). I recommend taking a look at these, if you're new:

- [The Altar](_projects/the-altar.md)
- [Dream supplies]({% post_url 2019-05-08-dream-supplies %})
- [The Mind and Other Incipient Ecologies]({% post_url 2019-05-21-the-mind-and-other-incipient-ecologies %})

About once a week, I send out a handful of obscure links I find online as an [_Offering_](_projects/the-altar.md) to the gods of the internet. You can subscribe to my mailing list to get them.
