Oh hey, I've been expecting you. Welcome to my little node of the web. Since you're here, you should probably know a few things.

**BIO**

xiq is short for Francisco, my name

I'm based in Lisbon, Portugal

Currently a master's student in Computer Science, with a focus on AI

Thinking about AI Governance, Safety, and Policy

I also make some [music]( "gnu.html") and philosophy here

**WORK**

My interests range widely, and I do a lot of seemingly disconnected stuff. I'm using the website to make sense of the fractal-like side-quests. I document most of them at the [sidequests page](pages/sidequests.html "Sidequests page").

If you're the curious type, feel free to browse[ _The Vault_](pages/vault.html "The Vault..."). It's where I keep all my treasures: books, writings, and other links that have influenced my thinking or that I otherwise find important.
