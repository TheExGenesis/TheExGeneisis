I'm almost done with BSc + MSc in Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico, the University of Lisbon's engineering school. _The oldest and most prestigious of its kind in Portugal_ (I feel dirty writing this but we need that cred)

I did a bunch of things I might or might not end up posting about. For example: I spent a [semester in China]("_projects/china.md") and the one before that running the [university newspaper]("_projects/diferencial.md") while doing some extra credits in maths.

I did a lot more things including interesting projects, but for now have a lame list of the courses I took.
