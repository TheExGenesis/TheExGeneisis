Spent a semester living in Beijing as a Master's student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University. I learned a lot, traveled a lot through China and Tibet, and made many friends along the way. 

Picked up some mandarin, tried out digital nomadism and found it's within my reach as lifestyle.

I wrote about [how travelling is like gathering dream supplies](_posts/dream-supplies) while I was there.
