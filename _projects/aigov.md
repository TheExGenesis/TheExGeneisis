AI Governance is many things. I got into it a few years ago because of EA, more specifically 80k hours.

AI Safety, Strategy, and Policy are all interesting fields to work on. I'm still exploring which mixture of the three is the best fit.

Since I'm a CS student, I'll probably do my thesis on AI Safety, but I also want to do some policy work soon. (Maybe as an intern at an EU institution?)

Recently I was at the Human Aligned AI Summer School in Prague, where I met many wonderful people, and acquired a much clearer view of what's happening in the field of AI Safety.

In September I'll be attending the AI Governance Workshop in Zurich, where I expect to further some relations and achieve the same sort of clarity in the strategy and policy spaces.
