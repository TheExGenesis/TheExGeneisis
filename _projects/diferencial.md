For the first semester of 2018/2019 I acted as director at Diferencial, a publication on politics, science, and society ran by university students at Instituto Superior Tecnico in Lisbon. 
Sadly, I had to leave the next semester for a (slightly) unforeseen [semester abroad in Beijing]( "China Project").

<br>
During my term I:
  * delineated macrostrategy; (move from analog paper to purely online)
  * rebuilt [the website](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) (which has been further improved by the talented Paulo Moniz);
  * applied for funding through grants available to student groups;
  * communicated with university administration and student bodies;
  * dealt with logistics for a the publication and coordinated a team of writers and editors;
  * went to IKEA and remodeled the newspaper work room


<br>
I also wrote two articles (in Portuguese) while there:
* One is [an "autopsy" of the former Civics subject in Portuguese middle-school.](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/edicao/o-papel-do-ensino-na-formacao-civica/uma-autopsia-a-formacao-civica/)
* Another is [an essay on memes, modern civics, and digital democracy](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/edicao/a-ue-nao-esta-online/a-guerra-dos-memes/)
