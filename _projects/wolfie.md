After going through [OpenAI's Spinning Up in Deep RL tutorial](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/), I decided to try my hand at using Deep Reinforcement Learning to build a bitcoin trading bot, but since then I've found [this great repository](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader) on Github and will probably base any further work I do on it.
